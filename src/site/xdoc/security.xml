      <section name="CVE-2025-48924 ClassUtils.getClass(...) can throw a StackOverflowError on very long inputs">
        <p>
          ClassUtils.getClass(...) can throw a StackOverflowError on very long inputs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Affected versions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Apache Commons Lang (commons-lang:commons-lang) 2.0 through 2.6</li>
          <li>Apache Commons Lang (org.apache.commons:commons-lang3) 3.0 before 3.18.0</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Uncontrolled Recursion vulnerability in Apache Commons Lang.
        </p>
        <p>
          This issue affects Apache Commons Lang: Starting with commons-lang:commons-lang 2.0 to 2.6, and, from org.apache.commons:commons-lang3 3.0 before 3.18.0.
        </p>
        <p>
          The methods ClassUtils.getClass(...) can throw StackOverflowError on very long inputs. Because an Error is usually not handled by applications and libraries, a
          StackOverflowError could cause an application to stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.18.0, which fixes the issue.
